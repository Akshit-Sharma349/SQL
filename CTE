Common Table Expression OR CTE is one of the most widely used feature of SQL. is a temporary, named result set defined within an SQL query using the WITH keyword, which 
is used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts.
Following is a prime example of how CTE is used


use Sharma;

select * from emp;

WITH Sharma_CTE AS (
SELECT AGE,SALARY,CITY FROM EMP WHERE AGE<30)

SELECT AGE,SALARY,CITY FROM Sharma_CTE WHERE CITY = "DELHI";

WITH HighSalaryCTE AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 50000),
LowSalaryCTE AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary <= 50000
)
SELECT 'High Salary' AS Category, *
FROM HighSalaryCTE
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS Category, *
FROM LowSalaryCTE;
